# Stripe Invoice Generator: Create Invoices Effortlessly with Next.js

![Stripe Invoice Generator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-brightgreen.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg) ![Deploy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy%20to-Vercel-00C7B7.svg)

A simple, free invoice generator for Stripe one-time payments built with Next.js. This project was born out of frustration with having to manually create invoices for Stripe payments and not wanting to pay for external services. I coded this tool to streamline the process.
